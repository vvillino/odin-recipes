<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A form of street-food sandwich from Campania, served hot</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 kg Bread Flour</li>
    <li>680 gr Cold refrigerator water</li>
    <li>3 gr Fresh brewers yeast or 1 dry</li>
    <li>25 gr Salt</li>
    <li>Cheeses of your choice (mozzarella, provola)</li>
    <li>fresh tomatoes</li>
    <li>mixed salad</li>
    <li>Extra virgin olive oil</li>
</ul>
<h4>Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>A spiral machine was used for the dough but it can be done both by hand and with a planetary mixer.</li>
    <li>Then add 90% of the water and await absorption by slightly increasing the speed (105 rpm). Once absorbed, add the salt and slowly add the remaining missing water, increasing the speed to 125 rpm.</li>
    <li>In 18 minutes dough closed, 25°</li>
    <li>I form a single loaf and put it in a closed oiled container for 1 hour at room temperature.</li>
    <li>After that I put it in the fridge for 16 hours</li>
    <li>Removed from the fridge, cut after 30 minutes and placed in starch for 6 hours and 30 minutes,</li>
    <li>Took 3 panielli weighing about 220 grams (with the others I made Neapolitans) spread without creating a ledge, giving an elongated shape</li>
    <li>Baked in Effeuno p134h at 400°, when it swells well I placed the paddle on the upper part of the Neapolitan panuozzo to prevent it from burning by going too close to the upper heating element</li>
    <li>Heated up today at 200° for 5/7 minutes turning it from time to time</li>
</ol>
